    - Rendering depth maps (:meth:`render_depths`, :meth:`render_images_and_depths`).

    - Saving and loading Gaussian splat data to/from PLY files (:meth:`save_to_ply`, :meth:`from_ply`).

    - Concatenating multiple :class:`GaussianSplat3d` instances into a single instance (:meth:`cat`).

    Background
    -----------

    Mathematically, the radiance field represented by a :class:`GaussianSplat3d` is defined as a sum of anisotropic 3D Gaussians,
    with view-dependent features represented using spherical harmonics. The radiance field :math:`R(x, v)` accepts as
    input a 3D position :math:`x \\in \\mathbb{R}^3` and a viewing direction :math:`v \\in \\mathbb{S}^2`, and is defined as:

    .. math::

        R(x, v) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} o_i \\cdot \\alpha_i(x) \\cdot SH(v; C_i)

        \\alpha_i(x) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}(x - \\mu_i)^T \\Sigma_i^{-1} (x - \\mu_i)\\right)

        \\Sigma_i = R(q_i)^T \\cdot \\text{diag}(S_i) \\cdot R(q_i)

    where:

    - :math:`N` is the number of Gaussians (see :attr:`num_gaussians`).
    - :math:`\\mu_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^3` is the mean of the i-th Gaussian (see :attr:`means`).
    - :math:`\\Sigma_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3 \\times 3}` is the covariance matrix of the i-th Gaussian,
      defined by its scale diagonal scale :math:`S_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^3` (see :attr:`scales`) and orientation
      quaternion :math:`q_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^4` (see :attr:`quats`).
    - :math:`o_i \\in [0, 1]` is the opacity of the i-th Gaussian (see :attr:`opacities`).
    - :math:`SH(v; C_i)` is the spherical harmonics function evaluated at direction :math:`v` with coefficients :math:`C_i`.
    - :math:`R(q_i)` is the rotation matrix corresponding to the quaternion :math:`q_i`.

    To render images from a :class:`GaussianSplat3d`, you volume render the radiance field using

    .. math::

        I(u, v) = \\int_{t \\in r(u, v)} T(t) R(r(t), d) dt

    where :math:`r(u, v)` is the camera ray through pixel :math:`(u, v)`, :math:`d` is the viewing direction of the ray,
    and :math:`T(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\int_{0}^{t} R(r(s), s) ds\\right)` is the accumulated transmittance along the ray up to distance :math:`t`.

    and to render depths you compute

    .. math::

        D(u, v) = \\int_{t \\in r(u, v)} t \\cdot T(t) \\sum_{i=1}^{N} o_i \\cdot \\alpha_i(r(t), d) dt

        Render a set of images from Gaussian splats that have already been projected onto image planes
        (See for example :meth:`project_gaussians_for_images`).
        This method is useful when you want to render images from pre-computed projected Gaussians,
        for example, when rendering crops of images without having to re-project the Gaussians.

        .. note::

            If you want to render the full image, pass negative values for ``crop_width``, ``crop_height``,
            ``crop_origin_w``, and ``crop_origin_h`` (default behavior). To render full images,
            all these values must be negative or this method will raise an error.

        .. note::

            The output always has the requested crop size. Where the crop runs past the image boundary,
            the part inside the image is rendered and the rest is filled with the background at zero
            alpha; a crop that lies entirely outside the image is all background. The stage function
            returns the clipped part only (empty for a crop entirely outside); this method pads it. Either
            way the output is differentiable with respect to the projection whenever the projection is.

        Args:
            projected_gaussians (ProjectedGaussianSplats): An instance of :class:`fvdb_reality_capture.ProjectedGaussianSplats`
                containing the projected Gaussians after spherical harmonic evaluation. This object should have been created by calling
                :meth:`project_gaussians_for_images`, :meth:`project_gaussians_for_depths`,
                :meth:`project_gaussians_for_images_and_depths`, etc.
            crop_width (int): The width of the crop to render. If -1, the full image width is used.
                Default is -1. A crop that runs past the image edge is filled with the background at zero
                alpha outside the image, so the output always has the requested size.
            crop_height (int): The height of the crop to render. If -1, the full image height is used.
                Default is -1.
            crop_origin_w (int): The x-coordinate of the top-left corner of the crop. If -1, the crop starts at (0, 0).
                Default is -1.
            crop_origin_h (int): The y-coordinate of the top-left corner of the crop. If -1, the crop starts at (0, 0).
                Default is -1.
            tile_size (int | None): The size of the tiles to use for rendering. Taken from ``tiles`` when
                they are given, and 16 otherwise; passing both raises if they disagree. You shouldn't set
                this parameter unless you really know what you are doing.
            backgrounds (torch.Tensor | None): Optional background colors of shape ``(C, D)``.
                If ``None``, background is treated as 0.
            masks (torch.Tensor | None): Optional per-pixel boolean mask in crop coordinates, of the requested
                crop size ``(C, cropH, cropW)`` or of its size after clipping to the image, on the projection's
                device. ``True`` means render, ``False`` means skip (filled with background).
            tiles (GaussianTileIntersection | None): The tile intersections of ``projected_gaussians`` at
                ``tile_size``, from :meth:`ProjectedGaussianSplats.tile_intersection`. Computed here when
                ``None``. Pass them when rendering several crops from one projection, so the Gaussians are
                binned into tiles once rather than once per crop.

        Render dense images by rasterizing directly from world-space 3D Gaussians.

        This is similar to :meth:`render_images`, but the rasterization step is performed in 3D
        using per-pixel rays against the Gaussian ellipsoids (instead of rasterizing 2D conics
        produced by a projection step). This enables gradients w.r.t. Gaussian geometry
        (``means``, ``quats``, ``log_scales``) through rasterization, which is useful for
        Unscented Transform (UT)-based OpenCV camera models.

        Notes:
            - This is **dense-only**: outputs are dense tensors of shape ``(C, H, W, ...)``.
            - Tile intersection data is still computed from a (non-differentiable) projection
              step, so gradients can be discontinuous when small parameter changes cause a Gaussian
              to enter/leave a tile (or switch which tiles it overlaps).
            - Background compositing follows standard "over" alpha compositing. If
              ``backgrounds`` is provided, the output color is:

              ``color = sum_i (feat_i * alpha_i * T_i) + T_final * background``

              where ``T_final`` is the remaining transmittance at the end of rasterization, and
              ``alpha = 1 - T_final``.
            - ``masks`` is a **per-pixel** boolean mask of shape ``(C, H, W)``.
              ``True`` means render, ``False`` means skip (filled with background).
