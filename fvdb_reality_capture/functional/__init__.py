``fvdb_reality_capture.functional`` -- composable, differentiable Gaussian splatting.

Rendering is split into four stages that pass small frozen dataclasses between them, so a custom
pipeline can insert its own logic anywhere:

1. :func:`project_gaussians` projects the 3D Gaussians into every camera.
2. :func:`evaluate_gaussian_sh` turns spherical-harmonics coefficients into per-camera features.
3. :func:`intersect_gaussian_tiles` or :func:`intersect_gaussian_tiles_sparse` bins Gaussians into tiles.
4. :func:`rasterize_screen_space_gaussians`, :func:`rasterize_world_space_gaussians` or
   :func:`rasterize_screen_space_gaussians_sparse` alpha-blends the features.

Stages 3 and 4 take per-camera opacities, ``[C, N]``. Compute them once per render with
:func:`compute_gaussian_opacities` and pass the same tensor to every stage.

Every stage except tile intersection is differentiable. The kernels themselves live in
:mod:`fvdb.functional`; :class:`~fvdb_reality_capture.GaussianSplat3d` composes these stages.
