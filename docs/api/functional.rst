Functional Gaussian Splatting
=============================

.. module:: fvdb_reality_capture.functional

:mod:`fvdb_reality_capture.functional` exposes Gaussian splat rendering as four composable stages
that pass small frozen dataclasses between them. :class:`~fvdb_reality_capture.GaussianSplat3d`
is a thin wrapper that composes these stages; use them directly when you need to insert your own
logic between projection and rasterization, reuse a projection for several renders, or build a
training loop over plain tensors.

The kernels themselves live in :mod:`fvdb.functional` as flat, non-differentiable forward and
backward functions. The stages here attach autograd to them, so gradients flow through every stage
except tile intersection.

.. code-block:: python

   import torch
   import fvdb_reality_capture.functional as F
   from fvdb_reality_capture import CameraModel, GaussianRenderMode

   # Plain tensors: means [N, 3], quats [N, 4], log_scales [N, 3], logit_opacities [N],
   # sh0 [N, 1, 3], shN [N, K - 1, 3], world_to_cam [C, 4, 4], K [C, 3, 3]

   # Stage 1: project the 3D Gaussians into every camera
   projected = F.project_gaussians(
       means, quats, log_scales, world_to_cam, K, image_width=640, image_height=480
   )

   # Stage 2: view-dependent features from spherical harmonics
   features = F.evaluate_gaussian_sh(
       means, sh0, shN, world_to_cam, projected, render_mode=GaussianRenderMode.FEATURES
   )

   # Stage 3: bin Gaussians into image tiles (opacities enable tighter culling)
   tiles = F.intersect_gaussian_tiles(projected, logit_opacities)

   # Stage 4: alpha-blend into images
   images, alphas = F.rasterize_screen_space_gaussians(projected, features, logit_opacities, tiles)

   loss = torch.nn.functional.l1_loss(images, target_images)
   loss.backward()  # gradients reach means, quats, log_scales, logit_opacities, sh0 and shN

The sparse path renders an arbitrary set of pixels per camera. Swap stages 3 and 4 for
:func:`intersect_gaussian_tiles_sparse` and :func:`rasterize_screen_space_gaussians_sparse`; results
come back as :class:`~fvdb.JaggedTensor` in the order of the requested pixels, duplicates included.
The world-space path, :func:`rasterize_world_space_gaussians`, evaluates the 3D Gaussians along
per-pixel rays and is the training path for the unscented projection, whose kernel has no backward
pass.
